# Summary

This is a small script to retrieve differences between two csv files of networks. It was useful for a client at work, and I thougt it would be useful for someone else.

# Use

The script is not very efficient, it can be enhanced (with a sort on csv files and do the searches in a dichotomic way, or/and put the csv files in parameters of the script).

To use this script, just take a look at it, name the two csv files as in the source code, and run it, it will create two new files with the similarities on the files.
